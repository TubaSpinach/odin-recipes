Practicing HTML with the Odin Project

Starting on October 11, 2023 @ 9:53 am, I'm about to create a recipe website using (at first) only HTML. 

I'm predicting the use of ul and ol, perhaps nav, perhaps hr. I think it will be fun.

File structure prediction:
Odin-recipes
    |
    ---index.html
    ---recipes/
        |
        ---recipe 1
        --- etc.
    ---images/
        |
        ---image 1
        --- etc.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spicy cabbage soup is soup-er easy to make. We begin with 
        bacon, cooking down in the pot, so that we can sautee our cabbage and onions
        in the grease. The bacon gives us plenty of time to cut our veggies.
        Once everything is fried up, we can add the beef stock --
        only 12 minutes until done! What a great weekday meal.

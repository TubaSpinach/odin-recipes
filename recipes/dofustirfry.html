    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This yummy stir fry comes together quickly. It's fresh and filling, perfect
        for any weeknight meal. By brining the dofu, we get a nice crispy exterior and 
        deliciously soft interior. And we can prep everything while the dofu brines,
        so the whole meal can be finished in 45 minutes.
